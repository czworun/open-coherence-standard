# OCS — Regulatory Compatibility Note
Purpose

The Open Coherence Standard (OCS) is a voluntary evaluation framework designed to complement existing AI regulations, including the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689).

OCS does not replace regulatory compliance.
It translates structural and governance properties of AI models into a simplified coherence signal.

Regulatory Alignment

OCS components map conceptually to existing regulatory dimensions:

OCS Component	Regulatory Correspondence
S — Structural Transparency	Technical documentation & training data disclosure
E — Computational Proportionality	Risk assessment of scale and systemic impact
R — Auditability	Access for evaluation, reporting obligations
C — Governance & Stability	Risk management systems, quality management, compliance processes

OCS is not a legal certification.
It is a structural signal that may assist stakeholders in understanding a model’s posture relative to regulatory expectations.

Intended Role

OCS may serve as:

A pre-compliance self-assessment tool

A public transparency signal

A comparative governance framework

A documentation supplement alongside Model Cards

OCS does not define legal risk categories.
It defines structural coherence.

Why Simplicity Matters

Regulatory environments are complex.
OCS v0.1 intentionally remains lightweight to reduce barriers to voluntary adoption.

More advanced temporal and longitudinal metrics may be introduced in future versions.

Status

OCS is experimental and community-driven.
It is not affiliated with any regulatory body.

Its purpose is to support a culture of measurable responsibility in AI development.
